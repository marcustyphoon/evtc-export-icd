# evtc-export-icd
hacked together code to simulate gw2 internal cooldowns

for use with https://github.com/gw2scratch/evtc-exporter

no, I would not recommend doing this in node, but hey, it's what I know and it took me like an hour

usage: put EvtcExport binary and evtc files in this directory, name evtc files something descriptive, and run `node evtcExportAndSim.mjs`
